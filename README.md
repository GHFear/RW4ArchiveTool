**Features I need to add:** <br>
-Error handler that catches any errors and exits cleanly.  <br>
(Right now the tool is relying completely on the assumption that the file you give it isn't corrupt <br>
and terrible corruption of data and memory could be a side effect of trying to load corrupted files) <br>
-Settings menu where you can force parse type and do other important things like settings the different struct types and values manually. <br>
-Open FileDialog to select output path when unpacking files. <br>
-Multi-archive unpacking. <br>
-Single file export. <br>
